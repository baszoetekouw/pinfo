Pinfo is user-friendly, console-based viewer for Info documents.
Hope you like it :)

Until version 0.6.8, Pinfo was maintained by Przemek Borys. His old project
page is still available at http://pinfo.sourceforge.net/. Unfortunately,
Przemek is no longer active, and development was taken over by Bas Zoetekouw
and moved to Alioth: https://alioth.debian.org/projects/pinfo/.
Since 2014 (version 0.6.10), development has moved to Github: 
https://github.com/baszoetekouw/pinfo

See man page (pinfo.1) for details.
