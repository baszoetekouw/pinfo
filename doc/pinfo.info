   `pinfo' [OPTIONS] [INFO_PAGE]

   `pinfo' is a program for viewing info files. You specify which page
you want to read by passing it an INFO_PAGE argument. This argumen t
contains the name of an info page (i.e. `bash'). The program will then
(by default) search for it in `./', `/usr/info', `/usr/share/info' and
`/usr/local/info'. Other searchpath may be specified in configfile or
via INFOPATH environmental variable.  Pinfo will also automaticaly add
the suffix `-info', `-info.Z', `-info.gz', or `-info.bz2'. At present
other suffixes are not recognized, but you can easily add them to the
function `openinfo()' in `filehandling_functions.c'.

   When the search for info pages fails, man is called with the
INFO_PAGE argument, and it's output is parsed by `pinfo'. This means
that when you don't have the appropriate info page, but have a man page
instead; the man page will be viewed.

   When no INFO_PAGE is specified, the default `dir' page is shown.

Supported OPTIONS are

`-h, --help'
     print help information and exit

`-v, --version'
     print version information and exit

`-m, --manual'
     uses manual page instead of info by default. (`pinfo' `-m' could
     be used as a manual pager). Warning: Everything what follows this
     option is passed to the `man' program. Don't be confused if
     `pinfo' options, which followed `-m' don't work.  When using this
     option, pinfo does not parse the info options as ussual!  It
     invokes the man part of program.

     You can also call the man function of `pinfo' in another way.
     When `pinfo' is called with an `argv[0]' (the program file name),
     which contains the word `man' in it's name, the man functions are
     enabled automatically.

     Previously there was a symlink to `pinfo', called `pman', but I
     had to remove it from the distribution, since it's name was in
     conflict with some other utility. Anyway, you can feel free to
     create such a link if you wish.

`-r, --raw-filename'
     uses a raw filename first (i.e.  the name which you specified as
     infopage is considered to be a real file in the specified
     location).

`-f, --file'
     Same as '-r'.

`-a, --apropos'
     if this is set, apropos is called when no man or info page could be
     found.

`-c, --cut-man-headers'
     if this is set, man parsing code will try to cut out the repeated
     man headers. Use with care. ;)

`-s, --squeeze-lines'
     cut empty lines from manual pages. This option enables autocutting
     of every repeated newline in a manual page.

`-t, --force-manual-tag-table'
     forces manual detection of tag table. This allows you to view info
     pages, which may be corrupted.  (as i.e.  version of jed's pages,
     shipped with RH5.0). The tag table corruption ussualy appears in
     that the info links, which you follow, move you to quite
     unexpected nodes.

`--node=NODENAME, --node NODENAME'
     Go to the node NODENAME of info file. Since 0.6.7 it is also
     possible to specify nodes as in standalone info via filenames, like
     `(gcc)Introduction'.

`--rcfile=FILENAME, --node FILENAME'
     Use alternate rcfile.

`-l, --long-manual-links'
     Use long link names in manuals.  On some systems the manual
     hierarchy is divided into subsections like `3ncurses', etc, while
     on other systems all belongs to section `3'. If this option is
     what your system is like, feel free to use it.

`-x, --clear-at-exit'
     Clear screen at exit.

   The options are handled by GNU getopt, so you can here as in other
programs abbreviate the option names to the minimal number of characters
by which the options differ.

   Warning! If you do not have getopt, these options will not work!

Configuration
*************

* Menu:

* Environment::                 Variables.


File: pinfo.info,  Node: Configuration file,  Next: Environment,  Prev: Configuration,  Up: Configuration

Configuration file
==================

   Just take a look at the example config file, *Note Example config
file::, and at the key descriptions, *Note Keys::. Keys available in
manual viewer differ a bit from the keys available in info viewer.

   There are configuration files called `~/.pinforc' and
`[prefix]/etc/pinforc', for local and global configuration (where
prefix is the prefix of the directory, where `pinfo' is installed, i.e.
`/usr/local', or `/usr').

* Menu:

* Color::                       Color settings.
* Keys::                        Bindable keyboard.
* Options::                     Confiruration options.
* Example config file::         Build in values.


File: pinfo.info,  Node: Color,  Next: Keys,  Prev: Configuration file,  Up: Configuration file

Color
-----

   First you must enter a color name (all available color names are
present in the example, *Note Example config file::, and they're self
explanatory, I think.

   There is also a special color COLOR_DEFAULT, which stands for
transparency). Then you enter the foreground color, and the background
color.

   The BOLD attribute means that we want the foreground color to be
highlighted. (i.e.  lightblue, lightgreen).  BLINK attribute is the
blinking attribute, or highlighted background in some other
configurations.


File: pinfo.info,  Node: Keys,  Next: Options,  Prev: Color,  Up: Configuration file

Keys
----

   Now let's move to the key definitions. Here we first put a key name
(again all keys are present in the example); then we enter it's value -
either surrounded by apostrophes, or a keycode number (like in
KEY_REFRESH_1), or its mnemonic code name if it's a special key (like
i.e.  in KEY_FOLLOWLINK_1).

   If you wish to specify key by code value, use the supplied program
'testkey' to obtain the needed value. It mainly is a feature, when you
want to add some ctrl+letter keybindings, and similar.

   For each function you can bind two keys, i.e.  you could bind both
Enter and Cursor Right to the FollowLink-function.  As you can see in
the example above, the two key names are KEY_FOLLOWLINK_1 and
KEY_FOLLOWLINK_2.

     combination.

'C'
     this means a printable character c. The syntax is just like in
     C/C++ ;).

[NUMBER]
     you can also specify key as it's code number.  It is useful e.g.
     when specifing control keys, and some nonstandard keys.  A
     numerical value of zero turns given keybinding off.

   See manual page for curs_getch(3x) for description of their meaning.

   Warning!  Try not to create some serious keybinding conflicts!


File: pinfo.info,  Node: Options,  Next: Example config file,  Prev: Keys,  Up: Configuration file

Options
-------

   The options in the last part of the example configuration file
should be fairly self-explanatory.  The variables that can be set to
true or false do the same things as the commandline arguments with the
same names.

MANUAL
     If this is set to true the default is to first check for a man
     page, instead of a texinfo file.

CUT-MAN-HEADERS
     If set to true, then pinfo tries to cut off the repeated headers
     throughout man pages.

CUT-EMPTY-MAN-LINES
     If set to true, then pinfo tries to cut off the repeated newlines
     (i.e.  it will shorten each set of consecutive newlines to one
     newline).

RAW-FILENAME
     If set to true, the file argument is taken to be the name of a
     file in the current working directory, i.e.  the directories in
     `INFOPATH' will only be searched if a file with this name is not
     in the working directory.

APROPOS
     If set to true, apropos is called if no info or man page is found.

DONT-HANDLE-WITHOUT-TAG-TABLE
     If set to true, pinfo will not attempt to display texinfo pages
     without tag tables.

HTTPVIEWER
     Set this to the program you want to use to follow http links in
     documents.

FTPVIEWER
     Set this to the program you want to use to follow ftp links in
     documents.

MAILEDITOR
     Set this to your favourite email program, and it will be started
     if you follow an email link in a document.

PRINTUTILITY
     Utility, which you use for printing. I.e.  `lpr'. If you don't use
     any, you may also try something like `cat >/dev/lp1', or sth. ;)

MANLINKS
     This specifies the section names, which may be referenced in your
     man pages (i.e.  Xtoolkit man pages match the section 3Xt (see for
     example XtVaCreateWidget) manpage), Xlib function pages match
     section 3X11, etc. Such extensions may not be recognized by
     default, so it is a good idea to add them).

INFOPATH
     This allows you to override the default search paths for info
     pages.  Paths should be separated by colons.

MAN-OPTIONS
     This specifies the options, which should be passed to the `man'
     program.  (see man(1) for description of what they're like).

STDERR-REDIRECTION
     Pinfo allows you to redirect the stderr output of called
     programms.  For example if you don't want to see man's error
     messages about manual page formatting, you can use
     `STDER-REDIRECTION"> /dev/null"'.  This is the default.

LONG-MANUAL-LINKS
     This is another true/false option, which decides whether your
     system supports long manual section names, or not.  (i.e.
     "3ncurses" instead of "3").

FILTER-0XB7
     This decides, whether you want to convert 0xb7 chars to `o', or
     not.  For example for iso-8859-2 fonts this makes man's list marks
     a bit nicer ;) (look for example at perl's man page, to see how
     those marks look like).

QUIT-CONFIRMATION
     This decides whether you want to use quit confirmation on exit, or
     not.

QUIT-CONFIRM-DEFAULT
     This yes/no option determines the default answer to the
     QUIT-CONFIRMATION dialog.  (default answer is when you press a
     key, that does not match the asked question).

CLEAR-SCREEN-AT-EXIT
     This true/false option determines if you want to have your screen
     cleared at exit, or no.

CALL-READLINE-HISTORY
     This true/false option determines if you want to have a prompt of
     last history entry whenever calling readline wrapper, eg. in
     subsequent searches.

HIGHLIGHTREGEXP
     This is an option, through which you may pass to pinfo regexps,
     which should be highlighted when working with document.  Warning!
     This may turn very slow if you use it without care!

SAFE-USER
     This option is used to pass the name of user, to which suid when
     pinfo is run with root privileges.

SAFE-GROUP
     This option is used to pass the name of group, to which suid when
     pinfo is run with root privileges.

Environment
===========

   There is a variable `$INFOPATH', which can specify the paths to  be
searched for info files. It's format is similar to that of the `$PATH'
variable. An example setting could look like:

   `/usr/info:/usr/somewhere/info:/not/even/in/usr/info'

   etc. Directories are separated by colons.

Internationalization Support
****************************

   Pinfo implements general features of gnu gettext library (the thing,
which you need to see national messages ;). But it is not the end.
Pinfo allows you to use national info pages! You only need to put them
to your info directory, into a subdirectory, which is called `$LANG'.
