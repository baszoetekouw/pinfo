.TH PINFO 1 "01 Dec 2001"
.SH NAME
.B pinfo
\- is user-friendly, console-based viewer for Info documents
.SH SYNTAX
.B pinfo 
[\fIoptions\fR]
[\fBinfopage\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a program for viewing info files. You specify which page you want to
read by passing it an
.I infopage
argument. This argument contains the name of an info page (i.e. 'bash').
The program will then (by default) search for it in the current directory,
.IR "/usr/share/info",
.IR "/usr/info",
.IR "/usr/local/share/info",
.IR "/usr/local/info".
and
.IR "/opt/info".
The search path can be adjusted by INFOPATH environment variable or in the configuration
file. Pinfo will also automatically add the suffix '-info', '-info.Z', '-info.gz', or '-info.bz2'.
.P
When the search for info pages fails, man is called with the infopage
argument, and its output is parsed by pinfo. This means that when you don't
have the appropriate info page, but have a man page instead; the man page
will be viewed.
.P
When no \fIinfopage\fR is specified, the default `dir' page is shown.
.P
Supported options are
.P
.BR "-h", 
.B --help
\- print help information and exit.
.P
.BR "-v", 
.BR --version
\- print version information and exit.
.P
.BR "-m",
.BR --manual 
\- uses manual page instead of info by default. (pinfo -m could be used as a
manual pager). \fBWarning\fR: Everything what follows this option is passed
to the `\fIman\fR' program. Don't be confused if pinfo options, which
followed `\fB-m\fR' don't work. When using this option, pinfo does not parse
the info options as usual! It invokes the man part of program.
.P
You can also call the man function of pinfo in another way. When pinfo is
called with an argv[0] (the program file name), which contains the word 'man'
in its name, the man functions are enabled automatically.
.P
Previously there was a symlink to pinfo, called pman, but I had to remove it
from the distribution, since its name was in conflict with some other
utility. Anyway, you can feel free to create such a link if you wish.
.P
.BR "-r",
.BR --raw-filename 
\- uses a raw filename first (i.e. the name which you specified as
\fIinfopage\fR is considered to be a real file in the specified location).
.P
.BR "-f",
.BR --file 
synonym for -r.
.P
.BR "-a",
.BR --apropos 
\- if this is set, apropos is called when no man or info page could be found.
.P
.BR "-c",
.BR --cut-man-headers 
\- if this is set, man parsing code will try to cut out the repeated man
headers. Use with care. ;)
.P
.BR "-s",
.BR "--squeeze-lines" \-
cut empty lines from manual pages. This option enables auto cutting of every
repeated newline in a manual page.
.P
.BR "-t",
.BR "--force-manual-tag-table" \-
forces manual detection of tag table. This allows you to view info pages,
which may be corrupted. (as i.e. version of jed's pages, shipped with
RH5.0). The tag table corruption usually appears in that the info links,
which you follow, move you to quite unexpected nodes.
.P
.BR "--node=\fInodename\fB",
.BR "--node \fInodename\fB" \-
Go to the node `\fInodename\fR' of info file. Since 0.6.7 it is also
possible to specify nodes as in standalone info via file names, like
`(gcc)Introduction'.
.P
.BR "--rcfile=\fIfilename\fB",
.BR "--rcfile \fIfilename\fB" \-
Use alternate configuration file.
.P
.BR "--long-manual-links",
.BR "-l" \-
Use long link names in manuals. On some systems the manual hierarchy is
divided into subsections like `3ncurses', etc, while on other systems all
belongs to section `3'. If this option is what your system is like, feel
free to use it.
.P
.BR "--clear-at-exit",
.BR "-x" \-
Clear screen at exit.
.P
The options are handled by GNU getopt, so you can here (as in other
programs) abbreviate the option names to the minimal number of
characters by which the options differ.
.P
Warning! If you do not have getopt, these options will not work!
.P
.SH DEFAULT KEYS WHEN BROWSING INFO FILE
.P
Just take a look at the example configuration file (below), and at the key 
descriptions. Keys available in manual viewer differ a bit from the keys 
available in info viewer.
.P
.SH ENVIRONMENT
There is a variable $INFOPATH, which can specify the paths to be searched
for info files. It's format is similar to that of the $PATH variable. An
example setting could look like:
.P
.B /usr/info:/usr/somewhere/info:/not/even/in/usr/info
.P
etc. Directories are separated by colons.

.SH COLOR AND KEY DEFINITIONS
.P
There are configuration files called ~/.pinforc and
[prefix]/etc/pinforc, for local and global configuration (where prefix is the
prefix of the directory, where pinfo is installed, i.e. /usr/local, or /).
Here's an example of such a file; we'll discuss the contents below:
.P
.nf
.sp

.P
As you can see, the format is simple. First I'll explain the color
definitions. First you must enter a color name (all available color
names are present in the example, and they're self explanatory, I
think. There is also a special color COLOR_DEFAULT, which stands for
transparency). Then you enter the foreground color, and the background
color. The BOLD attribute means that we want the foreground color to
be highlighted. (i.e.  light blue, light green). BLINK attribute is the
blinking attribute, or highlighted background in some other configurations.
.P
Now let's move to the key definitions. Here we first put a key name (again
all keys are present in the example); then we enter its value -- either
surrounded
by apostrophes, or a keycode number (like in KEY_REFRESH_1), or its mnemonic
code name if its a special key (like i.e. in KEY_FOLLOWLINK_1).
.P
If you wish to specify key by code value, use the supplied program 'testkey'
to obtain the needed value. It mainly is a feature, when you want to add
some CTRL+letter keybindings, and similar.
.P
For each function you can bind two keys, i.e. you could bind both
Enter and Cursor Right to the FollowLink-function.  As you can see in
the example above, the two key names are KEY_FOLLOWLINK_1 and
KEY_FOLLOWLINK_2.

.TP 
.BR KEY_END " [Note: this works probably \fBONLY\fR with Linux ncurses]"
.TP
.B KEY_F(x)
.TP
.B KEY_CTRL('c')
\- this assigns the key value to a \fIctrl+c\fR combination. \fIc\fR may be
any letter you wish.
.TP
.B KEY_ALT('c')
\- this assigns the key value to a \fIalt+c\fR combination. \fIc\fR may be
any letter you wish. If \fIalt\fR key won't work, you may use \fIESC+key\fR 
combination.
.TP
.B 'c'
\- this means a printable character \fIc\fR. The syntax is just like in
C/C++ ;).
.TP
.B [number]
\- you can also specify key as its code number. It is useful e.g. when
specifying control keys, and some nonstandard keys.
A numerical value of zero turns given key binding off.

.RE
See manual page for curs_getch (3x) for description of their meaning.
.P
Warning! Try not to create some serious key binding conflicts!
.P
The options in the last part of the example configuration file should
be fairly self-explanatory.  The variables that can be set to true or
false do the same things as the command line arguments with the same
names. 
.RS
.sp
.TP 1.0i
.B MANUAL 
If this is set to
.B true
the default is to first check for a man page, instead of a texinfo
file.
.TP 
.B CUT-MAN-HEADERS 
If set to true, then pinfo tries to cut off the repeated headers
throughout man pages.
.TP
.B CUT-EMPTY-MAN-LINES
If set to true, then pinfo tries to cut off the repeated newlines (i.e. it
will shorten each set of consecutive newlines to one newline).
.TP
.B RAW-FILENAME
If set to true, the file argument is taken to be the name of a file in
the current working directory, i.e. the directories in
.B INFOPATH
will only be searched if a file with this name is not in the working
directory.
.TP
.B APROPOS
If set to true,
.B apropos
is called if no info or man page is found.
.TP
.B DONT-HANDLE-WITHOUT-TAG-TABLE
If set to
.B true
, pinfo will not attempt to display texinfo pages
without tag tables.
.TP
.B HTTPVIEWER
Set this to the program you want to use to follow http links in
documents.
.TP
.B FTPVIEWER
Set this to the program you want to use to follow ftp links in
documents.
.TP
.B MAILEDITOR
Set this to your favorite email program, and it will be started if
you follow an email link in a document.
.TP
.B PRINTUTILITY
Utility, which you use for printing. I.e. `lpr'. If you don't use any, you
may also try something like `cat >/dev/lp1', or sth. ;)
.TP
.B MANLINKS
This specifies the section names, which may be referenced in your man pages
(i.e. Xtoolkit man pages match the section 3Xt (see for example
XtVaCreateWidget)
manpage), Xlib function pages match section 3X11, etc. Such extensions may
not be recognized by default, so it is a good idea to add them).
.TP
.B INFOPATH
This allows you to override the default search path for info pages. The paths
should be separated by colons.
.TP
.B MAN-OPTIONS
This specifies the options, which should be passed to the `man' program.
(see man(1) for description of what they're like).
.TP
.B STDERR-REDIRECTION
Pinfo allows you to redirect the stderr output of called programs. For
example if you don't want to see man's error messages about manual page
formatting, you can use \fISTDER-REDIRECTION="2> /dev/null". This is the
default.
.TP
.B LONG-MANUAL-LINKS
This is another true/false option, which decides whether your system
supports long manual section names, or not. (i.e. "3ncurses" instead of "3").
.TP
.B FILTER-0xB7
This decides, whether you want to convert 0xb7 chars to `o', or not. For
example for iso-8859-2 fonts this makes man's list marks a bit nicer ;)
(look for example at perl's man page, to see how those marks look like).
.TP
.B QUIT-CONFIRMATION
This decides whether you want to use quit confirmation on exit, or not.
.TP
.B QUIT-CONFIRM-DEFAULT
This yes/no option determines the default answer to the QUIT-CONFIRMATION
dialog. (default answer is when you press a key, that does not match the
asked question).
.TP
.B CLEAR-SCREEN-AT-EXIT
This true/false option determines if you want to have your screen cleared at
exit, or no.
.TP
.B CALL-READLINE-HISTORY
This true/false option determines if you want to have a prompt of last
history entry whenever calling readline wrapper, eg. in subsequent searches.
.TP
.B HIGHLIGHTREGEXP
This is an option, through which you may pass to pinfo regexps, which should
be highlighted when working with document. Warning! This may turn very slow
if you use it without care!
.TP
.B SAFE-USER
This option is used to pass the name of user, to which suid when pinfo is
run with root privileges.
.TP
.B SAFE-GROUP
This option is used to pass the name of group, to which suid when pinfo is
run with root privileges.

.SH INTERNATIONALIZATION SUPPORT
Pinfo implements general features of gnu gettext library (the thing, which
you need to see national messages ;). But it is not the end. Pinfo allows
you to use national info pages! You only need to put them to your info
directory, into a subdirectory, which is called `$LANG'.
